    I work on the Azure DevEx team at Microsoft on cloud native developer tools and experiences.
    In particular, I am the product lead for the Azure Developer CLI (azd). Before that, I:
    *  Worked on drone reforestation software with Python as the first engineering hire at a seed-stage startup
    *  Built the data ingestion pipeline and platform that powers mapping software on millions of devices worldwide
    *  Was the inaugural product manager for the Pylance language server, powering Python developer experience for millions
    *  Managed a cross-product program focused on simplifying multi-device experiences for developers across any platform, operating system, or form factor
