    I work on on the Runtime team at Docker as the product lead for the Docker Engine, Docker CLI, WebAssembly support and other foundational components.
    Before that, I:
    *  Worked on drone reforestation software with Python as the first engineering hire at a seed-stage startup
    *  Built the data ingestion pipeline and platform that powers mapping software on millions of devices worldwide
    *  Was the inaugural product manager for the Pylance language server, powering Python developer experience for millions
    *  Managed a cross-product program focused on simplifying multi-device experiences for developers across any platform, operating system, or form factor
    *  Shipped a 0 -> 1 product that made it easier for developers to go from local dev environment to one of the largest cloud service providers in the world
