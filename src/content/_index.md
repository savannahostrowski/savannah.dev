Pronouns: she/they

I'm a software engineer working as a senior product manager at Microsoft focused on Azure cloud native developer tools and end-to-end experience. I'm the product lead for the open source [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/azure/azure-dev), which accelerates the time it takes for a developer to take an application from local development environment to the cloud (in minutes! with a single step! it rules!).

I'm also pretty passionate about the Python community and previously worked as the product manager for the [Pylance language server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) and on Python developer experience and productivity in products like VS Code, Visual Studio and on Azure.

I've also worked at Google/Android on multi-device developer experience on the [Cross Device SDK](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/cross-device-sdk/overview) and as a software engineer at a couple startups and consultancies.

I'm pretty much always learning about something. Right now it's Go, cloud native architecture, containers, K8s and infrastructure as code.

_This site is all open source code. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/savannahostrowski/terminal-personal-site). It's also an Azure Developer CLI template._
