## Who are you?

I'm Savannah Bailey (née Ostrowski - either last name is fine by me). If you've found yourself on this website, you might be wondering who I am and what I do. Here's a quick overview:

**I'm the Python 3.16 & 3.17 release manager**

This work is mostly upcoming but I'm excited to be the [10th ever Python release manager](https://discuss.python.org/t/welcome-the-3-16-and-3-17-release-manager-savannah-bailey/). I look forward to working with contributors, triagers, and the core development team to make these releases the best they can be over the next ~7.5 years. Pressure is on to figure out how I'm going to sign off on each release and make sure we have the best release swag ever!

**I'm a CPython core developer**

I was [promoted to core developer](https://discuss.python.org/t/vote-to-promote-savannah-ostrowski/) in November 2024 after serving on the triage team for a little under a year. I current work on both older and newer parts of the codebase, in Python and in C. Mostly notably, I help maintain the argparse module, the JIT compiler introduced as experimental in Python 3.13...and whatever else needs help. I'm having a lot of fun working with other contributors to make Python faster.

**I'm a PEP author**

I have authored or co-authored a couple PEPs, including [PEP 744](https://peps.python.org/pep-0744/) - JIT Compilation, and [PEP 774](https://peps.python.org/pep-0774/) - Removing the LLVM requirement for JIT builds.

**I'm the treasurer of the [Jupyter Foundation Governing Board](https://jupyter.org/governance/people.html#jupyter-foundation-governing-board)**

Alongside my role as a board member, I was elected to help manage the Jupyter Foundation Governing Boards's finances, develop strategy, process and budgets, and work with the Jupyter community to ensure the foundation is a good steward of its resources. 

**I work at Snowflake on Python developer experience**

I joined Snowflake in 2024 to lead Python developer experience. My focus is on making Snowflake the best platform for all things data in Python, from data engineering to data science and machine learning. I support teams across the company building Python tools, but these days, I’m primarily focused on the backend of our Notebooks product: Python runtimes, package management, kernels, compute infrastructure, and more.

## Fun facts and other non-tech stuff

- I'm an amateur ceramicist and spend a least a couple hours a week in the studio throwing clay on the wheel. I even donated some pieces to the PyLadies Auction at PyCon US 2025 (and plan to do so again next year).
- I have three cats named after Japanese foods: [Nori, Miso, and Momo](https://github.com/savannahostrowski/savannahostrowski/blob/main/cats.jpg). They are the lights of my life.
- I'm Canadian, but have been living in the US since 2016. I currently live in the Seattle, Washington area.
- I <3 Charli xcx. My favourite song is [Track 10](https://open.spotify.com/track/4t9PBD27dndlf6YMBK2ROc?si=9cfb3241e68c490d) from the [Pop 2](https://open.spotify.com/album/2HIwUmdxEl7SeWa1ndH5wC?si=WDkYy6bLQgeaqAGS3WP9wg) mixtape. I also walked down the aisle at my wedding to [party 4 u](https://open.spotify.com/track/2RdEC8Ff83WkX7kDVCHseE?si=affa043ef7474774). If you want to more music recommendations, you can check out my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/224tlpa3nu7dkd5srtvkvicfi?si=d23e7458f50e4f30). 
- I'm also a pretty avid reader and cinephile. You can see what I'm reading on my [Storygraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/seaquenched) or what I'm watching on my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/seaquenched/).
