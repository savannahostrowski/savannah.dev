## Who are you?

If you've found yourself on this website, you might be wondering who I am and what I do. Here's a quick overview:

**I'm the Python 3.16 & 3.17 release manager**

This work is mostly upcoming but I'm excited to be the [next Python release manager](https://discuss.python.org/t/welcome-the-3-16-and-3-17-release-manager-savannah-bailey/). I look forward to working with contributors, triagers, and the core development team to make these releases the best they can be over the next ~7.5 years. Pressure is on to figure out how I'm going to sign off on each release and make sure we have the best release swag ever!

**I'm a CPython Core Developer**

I was [promoted to core developer](https://discuss.python.org/t/vote-to-promote-savannah-ostrowski/) in November 2024 after serving on the triage team for a little under a year. I current work on both older and newer parts of the codebase, in Python and in C. Mostly notably, I help maintain the argparse module, the JIT compiler introduced as experimental in Python 3.13...and whatever else needs help. I'm having a lot of fun working with other contributors to make Python faster.

**I'm a PEP author**

I have authored or co-authored a couple PEPs, including [PEP 744](https://peps.python.org/pep-0744/) - JIT Compilation, and [PEP 774](https://peps.python.org/pep-0774/) - Removing the LLVM requirement for JIT builds.

**I work at FastAPI Labs**

As of October 2025, I work at [FastAPI Labs](https://fastapilabs.com/) helping build the future of deploying and managing FastAPI applications ðŸš€. You can read more about my decision to join the team in my [blog post](https://savannah.dev/posts/a-new-chapter/).

## Fun facts and other non-tech stuff

- I'm an amateur ceramicist and spend a least a couple hours a week in the studio throwing clay on the wheel. I even donated some pieces to the PyLadies Auction at PyCon US 2025 (and plan to do so again next year).
- I have three cats named after Japanese foods: [Nori, Miso, and Momo](https://github.com/savannahostrowski/savannahostrowski/blob/main/cats.jpg). They are the lights of my life.
- I'm Canadian, but have been living in the US since 2016. I currently live in the Seattle, Washington area.
