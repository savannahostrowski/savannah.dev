## Who are you?

If you've found yourself on this website, you might be wondering who I am and what I do. Here's a quick overview:

**I'm on the Python Steering Council**

As of December 2025, I'm a [Python Steering Council](https://peps.python.org/pep-8107/) member for the 2026 term. The Steering Council is responsible for the overall direction and governance of the Python programming language. You can read more about what this means to me in this [blog post](https://savannah.dev/posts/im-on-the-steering-council/).

**I'm the Python 3.16 & 3.17 release manager**

This work is mostly upcoming but I'm excited to be the [next Python release manager](https://discuss.python.org/t/welcome-the-3-16-and-3-17-release-manager-savannah-bailey/). I look forward to working with contributors, triagers, and the core development team to make these releases the best they can be over the next ~7.5 years. Pressure is on to figure out how I'm going to sign off on each release and make sure we have the best release swag ever!

**I'm a CPython Core Developer**

I was [promoted to core developer](https://discuss.python.org/t/vote-to-promote-savannah-ostrowski/) in November 2024 after serving on the triage team for a little under a year. I currently work on both older and newer parts of the codebase, in Python and in C. Most notably, I help maintain the argparse module, the JIT compiler introduced as experimental in Python 3.13...and whatever else needs help. I'm having a lot of fun working with other contributors to make Python faster.

**I'm a PEP author**

I have authored or co-authored a couple PEPs, including [PEP 744](https://peps.python.org/pep-0744/) - JIT Compilation, and [PEP 774](https://peps.python.org/pep-0774/) - Removing the LLVM requirement for JIT builds.

**I work at FastAPI Labs**

As of October 2025, I work at [FastAPI Labs](https://fastapilabs.com/) helping build the future of deploying and managing FastAPI applications 🚀. You can read more about my decision to join the team in my [blog post](https://savannah.dev/posts/a-new-chapter/).

## Fun facts and other non-tech stuff

- I have three cats named after Japanese foods: [Nori, Miso, and Momo](https://github.com/savannahostrowski/savannahostrowski/blob/main/cats.jpg). They are the lights of my life.
